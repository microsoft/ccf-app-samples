# Decentralized AuthZ application

This is the _CCF Decentralized AuthZ app - sample_ in typescript.

## Overview

The CCF network will be used to host a decentralized authorization service where different parties with membership (for example insurance providers, physician's practice and hospitals) will be able to manage the users and their roles. A user could belong to one or more organizations (for example, a hospital, an insurance provider or a physicians practice) and have a specific role in each organization. A user's organization and role is collectively called a Claim. 

## Architecture

The reconciliation application consists of two parts: User Management and Authorization.

- User Management
  - API Endpoint: allow members to add a user or remove a user.
- Authorization
  - Check if a user exist and get the claims.

## Getting Started

To get started and run the application locally, start with setting up the environment.

```bash
# setup the environment
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ccf-app-samples # Clone the samples repository
code ccf-app-samples                                   # open samples repository in Visual studio code

# In the VScode terminal window
cd decentralized-authz-app                             # Navigate to app folder
npm run build                                          # Build and create the application deployment bundle
```
