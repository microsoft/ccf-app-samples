### Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

[Architecture Decision Records](./docs/adr) are records for architecturally significant decisions: those that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, and techniques leveraged to build the data reconciliation app. Many of the ADRs evaluate future considerations if more customer requirements are defined. 


### Demo

For the demo, there are two primary documents:

- [Demo Overview](./docs/demo-overview.md) provides an overview of CCF, context for the data reconciliation scenario, and an example of how data is ingested, reconciled and reported. This overview is for an audience new to CCF and the data reconciliation scenario.
- [Demo Guidance](./docs/demo-guidance.md) provides a talk track as well as a step-by-step guide for running the E2E demo.
