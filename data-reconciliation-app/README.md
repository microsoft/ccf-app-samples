# CCF Data Reconciliation Application

This is the _CCF Data Reconciliation - sample_ in typescript.

## Overview

The CCF network will be used to host a reconciliation service where different parties with membership (banks and data providers) will be able to submit their own data to be reconciled against "each other's data" in a confidential manner without exposing the data to other members in the network.

When a new record(s) is submitted through ingestion endpoints, the application will search the key-value store by the record's key; if this key does not exist, it will be added; otherwise, a vote is added to this record with a member ID and the submitted value.

## Architecture

The reconciliation application consists of three main parts: Data Ingestion, Data Reconciliation and Data Reporting.

- Data ingestion
  - API Endpoint: allow members to submit their data to reconciled.
    - Accept single or batch of records
- Data reporting
  - API Endpoint: Members will query for results
    - Query by specific record by `a unique identifier`
    - Query all data
- Data reconciliation
  - Data is compared across all members, all members' data carry equal weight to reach consensus.
  - Reconciliation is on each record, not on the entire data set.

```

## Getting Started

To get started and run the application locally, start with setting up the environment.

```bash
# setup the environment
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ccf-app-samples # Clone the samples repository
code ccf-app-samples                                                 # open samples repository in Visual studio code

# In the VScode terminal window
cd data-reconciliation-app                             # Navigate to reconciliation sample folder
make build                                             # Build and create the application deployment bundle
```

Now the environment is ready, and there are several scenarios that could be executed at this stage.

- **Run the application's [e2e-tests](./test/test.sh) in a sandbox environment in the interactive mode**
  - `make demo`

- **Run the application's [e2e-tests](./test/test.sh) in a sandbox (simulated) environment**
  - `make test`

- **Run the application's [e2e-tests](./test/test.sh) on a Docker Container running a virtual (simulated) environment**
  - `make test-docker-virtual`

- **Run the application [e2e-tests](./test/test.sh) on a Managed CCF environment**
  - First, create a Managed CCF instance on your Azure subscription. Please follow [here](https://github.com/microsoft/ccf-app-samples/tree/main/deploy#deploying-the-ccf-samples)
  - Run the e2e-test, please follow [here](https://github.com/microsoft/ccf-app-samples/tree/main/deploy#deploying-a-ccf-application-to-azure-managed-ccf)

- **Start a CCF network with 3 active members and 1 user using the sandbox and deploy the application to it, the application and network are ready to receive requests**
  - `make start-host`

- **Run the application's unit tests**
  - `make unit-test`

These are the main scenarios; more commands are available at makefile and are described in the following section.

### Make file

A Makefile provides a front-end to interact with the project. It is used both locally, during CI, and on GitHub Actions. This Makefile is self-documented, and has the following targets:

```text
help                 💬 This help message :)
build                🔨 Build the Application
build-virtual        📦 Build Virtual container image from Dockerfile
build-enclave        📦 Build Enclave container image from Dockerfile
start-host           🏃 Start the CCF network using Sandbox.sh
test                 🧪 Test the Data Reconciliation Application in the sandbox
test-docker-virtual  🧪 Test the Data Reconciliation Application in a Docker sandbox
test-docker-enclave  🧪 Test the Data Reconciliation Application in a Docker enclave
test-mccf            🧪 Test the Data Reconciliation Application in a Managed CCF environment

clean                🧹 Clean the working folders created during build/demo
```

## Testing

There are 3 different types of network that this sample can be tested against; Sandbox, Docker, and Managed CCF. The script [./test.sh](./test/test.sh) is specific to this sample and is called by wrapper scripts that exist in the root [scripts](../scripts/) folder. These wrapper scripts are used for all samples.

|   Network   |                   Command                                 |                  Script                    |
| ----------: | --------------------------------------------------------: | -----------------------------------------: |
| Sandbox     | `make test`                                               | [test_sandbox](../scripts/test_sandbox.sh) |
| Docker      | `make test-docker-virtual` and `make test-docker-enclave` | [test_docker](../scripts/test_docker.sh)   |
| Managed CCF | `make test-mccf`                                          | [test_mccf](../scripts/test_docker.sh)     |

The wrapper scripts are responsible for starting the particular network with the correct constitution and setting up governance (users/members/application). The wrapper scripts will also close the network after the tests have finished (excluding mCCF).

### Demo

It is also possible to run the tests in _Demo mode_. This can be achieved by running

```bash
cd data-reconciliation-app    # Navigate to reconciliation sample folder
make demo                     # Run interactive end to end tests
```

There is a [guide](./docs/demo-guidance.md) here explaining what the demo shows. This will run the tests but require manual intervention so you can inspect the state of the network.
